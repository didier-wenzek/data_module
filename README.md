Exploring the idea to use modules Ã  la SML/OCaml to build a database as an assemblage of data modules.

Can we use OCaml modules to encapsulate datasets with all the mechanisms and information so a query engine can:

* efficiently process datasets that have been independly designed,
* abstract the queries from the actual internal representation of the data,
* leverage cost information and indexes to build efficient execution plan.
